Computational Complexity
========================

Now we have covered quite many concepts, algorithms, and data
structures. What remains is to see how all that fits together. That is
the purpose of *Computational Complexity theory*: Understand how
computational problems and algorithms relate. This is the core of
theoretical Computer Science and we will only introduce the very basic
concepts, starting with regular expressions, and formal
languages. From there, we will look at complexity classes, which
categorize computational problems---not algorithms---in to groups like
"feasible", "hard", etc. This explains the implications of the "P =
NP" question, yet still open.
