:Key concepts: graph (ADT), shortest path, spanning tree, flow network
:Data Structures: edge list, adjacency list, adjacency matrix
:Algorithms: graph traversals (depth-first, breadth-first), Dijkstra,
             Bellman-Ford, Floyd Warhsall, Prim, Kruskal, Floyd-Fulkerson

To Go Further
=============

Graph is a versatile concept that surfaces is every application
domain, from transportation to Biology. Here we only scratched the
surface, from the Computer Science angle. There are many resources
available to go further, including:

  edition, Springer.

- Wilson, R. J. (1996). Introduction to graph theory. 4th
  edition, Addison-Wesley.
