Optimization
============

Now we have studied the common algorithms and data-structures, we move
on to "optimization problems". For example, finding the shortest
paths, or the minimum spanning tree (as we have seen with graphs),
finding the cheapest set of items, etc.  We shall look at two main
scenarios: *Exhaustive search* when the set of possible configurations
is finite and/or small enough, and *heuristic search* for the
rest. Finally, we will look a *dynamic programming*, a method to speed
up recursive optimization algorithms.
