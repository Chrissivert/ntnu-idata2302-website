 Setup

There are several tools that you will need for these lab session,
namely, your favorite text editor, the Java development kit (JDK),
Apache Maven, and Git. I refer to the related documentation.

-  Code fragments are hosted on Github and the easiest way is to have
   Git installed on your machine. `See how to install
   Git. <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__

-  We will use Java as programming language, so you need to install the
   JDK. `See how to install the
   JDK. <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A>`__

-  I used Apache Maven as a build tool. See `how to install
   Maven. <https://maven.apache.org/install.html>`__

  
.. note::

   This is a theoretical course? Why do we need lab sessions? The point
   is to connect the theory and the practice: Show how that the concepts
   we learn matter when we program. This is **not** a Java programming
   course however. Please reach out if you struggle with technicalities.
