Practicalities
==============

Overall, we have three sessions a week during 13 weeks. Each session is
divided into 30 minutes of lectures and 1h30 of exercises or lab
session.

Lectures
========

I try to break down the content into 30 minutes long lectures. Each
lecture addresses a specific topic. I use various programming
languages as examples, avoiding those that are too verbose on
slides. Keep in mind that algorithms and data structures apply to any
programming language. I provide written lecture notes for the most
important lectures, so you can focus on understanding.

Lab Sessions
============

The lab sessions aim at putting concepts into practice. These are either
pen-and-paper exercises or programming tasks. Programming tasks are in
Java, but feel free to use any other language that makes things easier
for you. The point is to solve the programming tasks, not to struggle
with the programming language. There is no need to know Java programming
beforehand, but a prior exposure will help. I provide selected written
solutions, where I see fit.

    Weekly Quizzes
    --------------

    Every week, I will post a quiz to help you assess your understanding of
    the weekâ€™s topics. They do not account in your grade but please reach
    out if any thing is unclear.
